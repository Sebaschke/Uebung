%               Dieses Skript testet die selbst erstellte 
%               Matlab-Funktion normalizeMat()
%               zur Durchführung einer Äquilibrierung einer regulären 
%               Matrix

% Zeilenskalierung nach Skript S. 69
D_inf_rows = normalizeMat(A, 'infty', 'rows')
scaled_norm_inf_rows = norm(D_inf_rows*A, 'inf') % succesful

% Spaltenskalierung
D_one_cols = normalizeMat(A, 'one', 'cols')
scaled_norm_cols_one = norm(A*D_one_cols, 1) % succesful

% Die anderen Skalierungen funktionieren nicht
